= Scalability

We have tested our prototype with 3, 4 and 5 nodes.
The Leader election worked fine with all test configurations.
The situation where the Leader dies was tested with different configurations.
That worked well and new Leader was selected in all cases.
We also tested how our prototype solves the given SAT-problem.
It also worked with different inputs.

#include "optimizations.typ"
